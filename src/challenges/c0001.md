Running your first node
===

Docker simplifies the deployment and management of ScyllaDB. By using Docker containers, you can easily create isolated
ScyllaDB instances for development, testing, and production. Running ScyllaDB in Docker is the simplest way to
experiment with ScyllaDB, and we highly recommend it.

In the command prompt of your scylladb [terminal](tab-0) copy and run the following command:

```run
docker run -it --rm -d --name node1 \
  --network scylla \
  -p 9042:9042 \
  scylladb/scylla:6.2.1 \
  --smp 1 --memory 1G
```
